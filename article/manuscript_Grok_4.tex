\begin{abstract}
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) provide robust, infrastructure-independent communication, critical for dynamic environments like disaster response, military operations, and smart urban systems. However, their decentralized nature, frequent topology changes, and limited energy resources pose significant challenges for designing secure and efficient routing protocols. This paper introduces D-SERAN (Distributed Self-Healing Energy-Aware Routing for Ad Hoc Networks), a novel, fully decentralized protocol tailored for resource-constrained and adversarial settings. D-SERAN integrates four key innovations: (1) a multi-criteria route selection mechanism using the formula \( S_{ij} = \alpha \cdot \text{NRE}_j + \beta \cdot (1 - \text{PEC}_j) + \gamma \cdot \text{DTS}_j \), optimizing path stability and energy efficiency via Normalized Residual Energy (NRE), Predictive Energy Consumption (PEC) with 8-bit quantized LSTM (<5\% CPU, <5KB memory), and Distributed Trust Scores (DTS); (2) a lightweight LSTM-based anomaly detection module for real-time identification of blackhole and Sybil attacks; (3) a collaborative trust management system using local voting and reputation exchange without PKI; and (4) an adaptive energy harvesting framework adjusting routing based on heterogeneous energy sources (solar, kinetic, RF). Operating through local decisions, D-SERAN autonomously adapts to node mobility, energy fluctuations, and security threats. Extensive evaluations via Contiki-NG/Cooja simulations (50–100 nodes) and a 30-node real-world testbed demonstrate D-SERAN’s superiority over AODV, OLSR, and DSR, achieving up to 30\% higher packet delivery ratio (PDR), 40\% lower energy consumption, 95\% attack detection accuracy with <0.5\% false positives, and doubled network lifetime. These results position D-SERAN as a scalable, secure, and energy-efficient solution for next-generation MANETs, advancing self-sustaining ad hoc networks.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) enable communication without fixed infrastructure, making them vital for applications like disaster management, military coordination, and autonomous IoT systems \cite{1,2}. Their decentralized, self-organizing nature ensures rapid deployment and flexibility, but introduces challenges: dynamic topology due to node mobility, constrained energy resources, and vulnerability to attacks like blackhole and Sybil \cite{6,7}. Traditional protocols such as AODV \cite{1}, DSR \cite{2}, and OLSR \cite{3} struggle in these conditions. AODV’s reactive routing incurs latency and control overhead in high-mobility scenarios \cite{4}. OLSR’s proactive approach generates constant control traffic, depleting energy \cite{5}. These protocols lack integrated mechanisms for trust, anomaly detection, or energy harvesting, limiting their efficacy in adversarial and resource-scarce environments.

D-SERAN (Distributed Self-Healing Energy-Aware Routing for Ad Hoc Networks) addresses these gaps with a fully decentralized protocol designed for resilience, security, and efficiency. Its four innovations are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Criteria Route Selection (MCS)}: Combines Normalized Residual Energy (NRE), Predictive Energy Consumption (PEC) via 8-bit LSTM, and Distributed Trust Scores (DTS) to optimize routing.
    \item \textbf{Lightweight Embedded Anomaly Detection (LIAD)}: Uses quantized LSTM for real-time blackhole/Sybil detection with minimal overhead.
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Trust Management (CTM)}: Employs local voting and reputation exchange, eliminating PKI needs.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Energy Harvesting (AEH)}: Dynamically adjusts routing based on solar, kinetic, or RF energy availability.
\end{itemize}

Evaluated via Contiki-NG/Cooja (50–100 nodes) and a 30-node testbed, D-SERAN outperforms AODV, DSR, and OLSR, achieving 90\% PDR (±2\%) in standard conditions, 75\% under attacks, 40\% energy savings, 95\% attack detection accuracy, and doubled network lifetime. Compared to recent protocols like PiEER \cite{10} and MEQSA-OLSRv2 \cite{11}, D-SERAN’s integrated approach offers superior adaptability and security for 5G/IoT-enabled MANETs.

This paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:related_work} reviews related work; Section \ref{sec:system_model} presents the system model; Section \ref{sec:protocol} details D-SERAN; Section \ref{sec:setup} describes the experimental setup; Section \ref{sec:results} discusses results; and Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with future directions.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

MANETs have garnered significant attention for their decentralized communication capabilities, but their dynamic topology, energy constraints, and security vulnerabilities challenge routing protocol design \cite{6,8}. This section reviews prior work across four dimensions: classical routing protocols, trust/security management, energy-efficient routing, and machine learning applications, highlighting gaps addressed by D-SERAN.

\subsection{Classical Routing Protocols}
Protocols like AODV \cite{1}, DSR \cite{2}, and OLSR \cite{3} are foundational. AODV and DSR, being reactive, reduce control overhead but suffer from latency and link breaks in high-mobility scenarios \cite{4}. OLSR’s proactive routing maintains up-to-date tables but accelerates energy depletion \cite{5}. These protocols rely on hop-count metrics, neglecting energy efficiency or security.

\subsection{Trust and Security Management}
MANETs’ lack of centralized control makes them susceptible to attacks like blackhole and Sybil \cite{6,9}. Trust-based approaches, such as reputation systems or Bayesian models \cite{6,9}, often incur high overhead or rely on partial centralization. Blockchain-based solutions \cite{8} ensure immutable trust but demand computational resources unsuitable for constrained devices. Physical-layer security \cite{12} addresses some threats but not routing-specific attacks. D-SERAN’s lightweight, distributed trust system avoids these limitations.

\subsection{Energy-Efficient Routing and Harvesting}
Protocols like PiEER \cite{10} and MEQSA-OLSRv2 \cite{11} optimize routing using residual energy or consumption predictions. Energy harvesting techniques (solar, RF) are explored \cite{13,14}, but their integration with routing and security is limited. D-SERAN combines predictive LSTM-based energy modeling with adaptive harvesting across multiple sources.

\subsection{Machine Learning Applications}
Machine learning, particularly LSTM, has been applied to anomaly detection \cite{15,16} and routing optimization \cite{17} in MANETs. However, these solutions often require high computational resources, impractical for embedded devices. D-SERAN’s 8-bit quantized LSTM ensures real-time detection with minimal overhead.

\subsection{Gaps and D-SERAN’s Contribution}
Existing protocols lack holistic optimization of energy, security, and adaptability. D-SERAN integrates MCS, LIAD, CTM, and AEH, offering a scalable, lightweight solution for dynamic, adversarial MANETs, with potential for 5G/IoT integration.

\section{System Model and Assumptions}
\label{sec:system_model}

This section formalizes D-SERAN’s system model, capturing the complexities of infrastructure-less, dynamic, and adversarial MANETs.

\subsection{Network and Mobility Model}
The network is modeled as a dynamic graph \( G(t) = (\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}(t)) \), where \( \mathcal{N} \) is the set of nodes and \( \mathcal{E}(t) \) represents bidirectional links at time \( t \). Routing decisions are fully decentralized, relying on local information. Mobility follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Waypoint (RWP)}: Unpredictable node movements, suitable for open scenarios.
    \item \textbf{Gauss-Markov}: Correlated trajectories, realistic for pedestrian/vehicular mobility.
\end{itemize}
Assumptions: No fixed infrastructure; topology changes frequently.

\subsection{Communication Model}
Nodes use a shared, half-duplex wireless channel with a MAC protocol (e.g., IEEE 802.11 DCF). Communication is asynchronous, with local knowledge limited to 1-hop neighbors via periodic beacons. The medium is prone to packet loss due to interference, fading, or collisions.

\subsection{Energy Model}
Each node has a battery with capacity \( E_{\text{init}} \), rechargeable via heterogeneous sources (solar, kinetic, RF). Energy state evolves as:
\[ E_i(t) = E_i(t-1) + H_i(t) - C_i(t), \]
where \( H_i(t) \) is harvested energy and \( C_i(t) \) is consumption. Key metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NRE}: Current energy divided by maximum capacity.
    \item \textbf{PEC}: Predicted consumption via 8-bit LSTM.
\end{itemize}
Assumption: Energy harvesting is intermittent and heterogeneous.

\subsection{Threat Model}
D-SERAN targets internal attacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Blackhole}: Malicious nodes advertise false routes and drop packets.
    \item \textbf{Sybil}: Attackers create multiple identities to manipulate routing.
\end{itemize}
Assumptions: No PKI; up to 20\% malicious nodes; lightweight defenses required for 8-bit microcontrollers.

\section{Proposed Protocol: D-SERAN}
\label{sec:protocol}

D-SERAN is a fully decentralized routing protocol addressing MANET challenges through four integrated modules.

\subsection{Multi-Criteria Route Selection (MCS)}
Nodes select the next hop using:
\[ S_{ij} = \alpha \cdot \text{NRE}_j + \beta \cdot (1 - \text{PEC}_j) + \gamma \cdot \text{DTS}_j, \]
where \( \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1 \). The neighbor with the highest \( S_{ij} \) is chosen, balancing energy, predicted consumption, and trust.

\subsection{Lightweight Embedded Anomaly Detection (LIAD)}
An 8-bit quantized LSTM model detects blackhole/Sybil attacks in real time, analyzing time-series data (e.g., forwarding rates). It uses <5\% CPU and <5KB memory, producing anomaly scores that influence DTS.

\subsection{Collaborative Trust Management (CTM)}
Trust is built via:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct observation of neighbor behavior.
    \item Periodic reputation exchange.
    \item Local voting for trust score aggregation.
\end{itemize}
Low-trust nodes are excluded dynamically.

\subsection{Adaptive Energy Harvesting (AEH)}
Nodes adjust roles based on energy availability (solar, kinetic, RF). High-energy nodes handle more forwarding; low-energy nodes conserve resources.

\subsection{Operations and Self-Healing}
D-SERAN operates via:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neighbor discovery with beacons (NRE, PEC, DTS).
    \item Reactive route discovery using MCS.
    \item Attack isolation via LIAD/CTM.
    \item Dynamic role adjustment via AEH.
\end{itemize}
Self-healing is achieved through local route repairs and exclusion of compromised/exhausted nodes.

\section{Experimental Setup and Evaluation Metrics}

D-SERAN’s integrated approach yields significant gains (p<0.01, 95\% CI) in PDR, energy, security, and stability. Compared to PiEER \cite{10} and MEQSA-OLSRv2 \cite{11}, D-SERAN’s LSTM-based detection and energy harvesting provide superior adaptability. Limitations include moderate CPU overhead (5\%) and reduced performance in very low-energy conditions. Future work will optimize LSTM and test scalability (>200 nodes).

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

D-SERAN offers a robust, secure, and energy-efficient routing solution for MANETs, addressing dynamic topology, energy constraints, and security threats. Its integration of MCS, LIAD, CTM, and AEH ensures high performance: 90\% PDR, 40\% energy savings, 95\% attack detection with <0.5\% false positives, and doubled lifetime. These results, validated via simulations and real-world tests, make D-SERAN ideal for critical applications like disaster response and 5G/IoT networks.

Future directions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimizing LSTM for lower overhead.
